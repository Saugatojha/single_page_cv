## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a well-structured, single-page CV using pure HTML with proper semantic markup, SEO optimization, and social media integration.

## 🎯 What I Learned

### 1. **Semantic HTML Structure**
- Used proper HTML5 semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<address>`)
- Understood the importance of semantic markup for accessibility and SEO
- Learned how to structure content in a meaningful, hierarchical way

### 2. **SEO Meta Tags**
- Implemented essential meta tags for search engine optimization
- Added meta description, viewport, charset, and robots tags
- Learned about canonical URLs and their importance in preventing duplicate content issues
- Understood the difference between local file paths and web server directory structures

### 3. **Open Graph (OG) Protocol**
- Implemented OG tags for better social media sharing previews
- Learned how different platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Messenger, Slack, Discord) use OG tags
- Understood the importance of proper image dimensions (1200x630px) for social previews
- Added Twitter Card tags for Twitter/X-specific optimization

### 4. **Favicon Implementation**

- Learned to check deployment status via GitHub Actions

### 7. **Social Media Cache Management**
- Discovered how social platforms cache link previews
- Learned to use debugging tools:
  - Facebook Debugger for scraping and cache refresh

### 8. **Web Fundamentals**
- Understood the concept of directories vs files in web hosting
- Learned about trailing slashes in URLs and their significance
- Discovered the difference between local development and production environments
- Learned about URL structures and canonical links

### 9. **Debugging & Testing**
- Used browser DevTools to view page source and verify deployed changes

- Practiced iterative testing and debugging workflows

### 10. **Professional Development**
- Learned the importance of proofreading (caught multiple typos!)
- Understood how to present technical information professionally
- Practiced attention to detail in code quality
